### Network Access Setup

To use the addon on other devices in your network (TV, phone, tablet):

1. **Find your computer's local IP address:**
   - Windows: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
   - macOS/Linux: `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in Terminal
   - Example: `192.168.1.100`

2. **Set the external URL:**
   ```bash
   EXTERNAL_URL=http://192.168.1.100:7000
   ```

3. **Restart the server**

4. **Access from other devices:**

   - Install the addon from there

### Firewall Configuration

Ensure port 7000 (or your chosen port) is open:

```bash
# macOS
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --add /usr/local/bin/node

## Usage Guide

### For Language Learning

**Recommended Setup:**
1. Set the language you're **learning** as the **Primary Language** (displayed on top)
2. Set your **native language** as the **Secondary Language** (shown on the second line with a marker and softer styling where the player supports it)
3. This way, you try to read and understand the primary language first, then verify with your native language

**Learning Tips:**
- Focus on reading the top subtitle first
- Only glance at the bottom subtitle when needed
- Pause on difficult scenes and repeat
- Take notes on new vocabulary
- Start with content you've seen before in your native language

### Best Content for Learning

| Content Type | Why It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| **TV Series** | Consistent vocabulary, recurring characters and contexts |
| **Animated Films** | Clear pronunciation, simpler vocabulary |
| **Romantic Comedies** | Everyday conversational language |
| **Documentaries** | Formal vocabulary, clear narration |
| **Children's Content** | Simple language, slow speech |

### Subtitle Selection in Stremio

1. Start playing any movie or series
2. Click the **subtitle icon** (CC) in the player
3. Look for options labeled with your language combination (e.g., "English + Turkish")
4. Select the dual subtitle option
5. Subtitles will appear with both languages

**Android TV compatibility note:**
- Dual subtitles are published with a standard single `lang` code for maximum client compatibility
- Because of this, your dual subtitle option appears under your **Primary Language** group in Stremio's subtitle list
- The dual entry remains easy to identify by its title format: `Dual (ENG+TUR) - English + Turkish`

## Technical Details

### Subtitle Processing Pipeline

```
1. Request received (movie/series ID + language config)
         ↓
2. Fetch available subtitles from OpenSubtitles API
         ↓
3. Filter by selected languages
         ↓
4. Download best matching subtitle files
         ↓
5. Detect and convert character encoding
         ↓
6. Parse SRT format (timing + text)
         ↓
7. Merge based on timestamp overlap
         ↓
8. Generate combined SRT output
         ↓
9. Return to Stremio player
```

### Merging Algorithm

The addon uses a time-based matching algorithm:

1. For each primary subtitle entry, find overlapping secondary entries
2. Match based on start/end time proximity (within 1 second tolerance)
3. Combine matched entries: primary line uses `<b>`, secondary line uses a `›` prefix plus `<i>` and a muted `<font color>` when the player renders HTML in SRT
4. Handle edge cases: missing translations, timing gaps

### Supported Encodings

| Category | Encodings |
|----------|-----------|
| Unicode | UTF-8, UTF-16 LE, UTF-16 BE |
| Windows | CP1250, CP1251, CP1252, CP1253, CP1254, CP1255, CP1256, CP1257, CP1258 |
| ISO | ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-15 |
| Other | KOI8-R, KOI8-U, GB2312, GBK, Big5, EUC-KR, Shift_JIS |

## FAQ

**Q: Is this addon free?**
A: Yes, completely free and open source. No premium features or hidden costs.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**
A: No. The addon works without any registration or API keys.

**Q: Does this work with all movies and series?**
A: It works with any content that has subtitles available on OpenSubtitles. Popular content has better coverage.

**Q: Can I use this on my TV?**
A: Yes. Install Stremio on your TV, then add the addon using the manifest URL or by setting up network access from your computer.

**Q: Why are some subtitles missing translations?**
A: If OpenSubtitles doesn't have subtitles for your chosen language pair for that specific content, no dual subtitles will be available.

**Q: Is my data collected?**
A: No personal data is collected. Anonymous usage statistics (page views, language preferences) may be tracked for analytics purposes only.

**Q: Can I use more than two languages?**
A: Currently, only two languages are supported (primary + secondary). Multi-language support may be added in the future.

**Q: Why do song lyrics not have translations?**
A: Some subtitle files only translate dialogue, not song lyrics. This depends on the original subtitle file from OpenSubtitles.

**Q: How do I report a bug?**
A: Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/ummugulsunn/stremio-dual-subtitles/issues) with details about the problem.

## Troubleshooting

### Subtitles Not Showing

1. **Check subtitle availability**: Not all content has subtitles for all languages
2. **Try different content**: Test with popular movies that have wide subtitle coverage
3. **Reinstall addon**: Remove and reinstall the addon in Stremio
4. **Clear Stremio cache**: Settings > Clear Cache in Stremio
5. **Check language selection**: Ensure you selected two different languages

### Encoding Issues (Garbled Text)

1. The addon auto-detects encoding for most files
2. Some rare encodings may not be supported
3. Report the issue with the movie/series title for investigation

### Connection Problems

1. **Firewall**: Ensure port 7000 is allowed
2. **URL**: Use IP address, not `localhost`, for network access
3. **EXTERNAL_URL**: Set correctly in `.env` for remote access

### Addon Installation Fails

1. **Multiple addons**: Remove all existing Dual Subtitles addons first
2. **Stremio restart**: Completely quit and restart Stremio
3. **Direct URL**: Try installing via manifest URL directly

### Server Won't Start

1. **Port in use**: Change PORT in `.env` or kill the process using port 7000
2. **Node version**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` again
